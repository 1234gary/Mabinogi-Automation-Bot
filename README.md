Uses Kanan's Bitmap Font. You might need to play around with your "c" key menu. It should be on the bottom left touching the left wall. However the dimension adjust wasn't used on it (due to mabi auto adjusting for me due to same account). On my computer its inline with bottom left corner, but you might have to make it go higher to make clicking work. Other than that, everything else is automatically dimension adjusted.
